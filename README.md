# ChatBot

## Description

ChatBot is a basic chatbot implemented in Python. It uses a dictionary to map user input to predefined responses, covering a variety of topics from greetings to providing information.

## Features

- Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", and "hey".
- Answers common questions such as "what's your name?" and "who is your creator?".

- Offers assistance with programming-related queries.

## Usage

To use ChatBot, simply run the `chatbot.py` script in your Python environment. The chatbot will prompt you to enter your message, to which it will respond accordingly.

Example usage:

| User Input | Bot Response |
|------------|--------------|
| hi         | Hello! How can I assist you today? |
| what's your name? | My name is ChatBot. Nice to meet you! |
| tell me a joke | Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything! |
| "hat's the time? | xx.xx.xxxx |
| What's your favorite movie? | I'm a bot, so I don't have personal preferences. But I can recommend some popular movies if you'd like! |

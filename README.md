# ChatBot

Welcome to ChatBot, a simple Python-based chatbot that engages in conversation with users!

## Description

ChatBot is a basic chatbot implemented in Python. It uses a dictionary to map user input to predefined responses, covering a variety of topics from greetings to providing information.

## Features

- Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", and "hey".
- Answers common questions such as "what's your name?" and "who is your creator?".
- Provides jokes, fun facts, and interesting information upon request.
- Offers assistance with programming-related queries.
- Engages in conversation about various topics like AI, books, and movies.

## Usage

To use ChatBot, simply run the `chatbot.py` script in your Python environment. The chatbot will prompt you to enter your message, to which it will respond accordingly.

Example usage:

# Example 1: Greeting
# User: hi
# Bot: Hello! How can I assist you today?
 
# Example 2: Asking for the bot's name
# User: what's your name?
# Bot: My name is ChatBot. Nice to meet you!

# Example 3: Requesting a joke
# User: tell me a joke
# Bot: Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

# Example 4: Asking for programming help
# User: Can you help me with Python?
# Bot: Of course! What do you need help with?

# Example 5: Engaging in conversation about movies
# User: What's your favorite movie?
# Bot: I'm a bot, so I don't have personal preferences. But I can recommend some popular movies if you'd like!

# Example 6: Customizing the bot's behavior
# User: How can I add new responses to the bot?
# Bot: You can modify the `responses` dictionary in the `chatbot.py` file. Just add new key-value pairs for different user inputs and bot responses.

# Feel free to try out these examples and explore the capabilities of ChatBot!
